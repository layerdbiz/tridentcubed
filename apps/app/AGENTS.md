# apps/app (Report Generator)

Product vocabulary: `docs/trident/CONTEXT.md` once #8 writes it (routed from root `CONTEXT-MAP.md`).
Roadmap: `docs/trident/roadmap.md`. Shared conventions: root `AGENTS.md`.
Layout confirmed against SvelteKit docs on #42
(`docs/research/2026-09-26-sveltekit-app-layout.md`).

## Layout

```text
src/hooks.server.ts            session lookup into event.locals (when auth arrives)
src/lib/server/                server-only code: db/, auth.ts, export-session-store.ts
src/lib/<feature>/             code two or more routes share: <feature>.remote.ts, .types.ts, .schema.ts
src/lib/components/<name>/     app-only components (business-shaped, so not @layerd/ui)
src/routes/<group>/<route>/    +page.svelte thin; <route>.svelte renders it; <route>.<role>.ts beside it
```

- A feature starts beside its route and moves to `src/lib/<feature>/` when
  a second route imports it.
- Support modules are `<folder>.<role>.ts` with the roles `remote`, `types`,
  `utils`, `schema`, `state`, `constants`. A colocated module that must stay
  server-only takes `.server.ts`.
- Route-colocated components are kebab nouns (`photo-grid.svelte`).
  Route-local types end in `Type`.
- Imports: `@layerd/ui` for the library, bare `$lib` for app code.

## Data

- Report definitions (inputs, panels, pages) are code in `src/lib/definitions/`,
  imported directly (`#lib/definitions/index.js`); no remote function reads them (#48).
- Remote functions are the data layer: `fetchX` for `query`, `query.batch`
  and `query.live`; `getXData` for `prerender`; `submitX` for `form`.
  `command` naming is decided on the platform map with persistence.
- Remote functions are public endpoints: each `.remote.ts` checks
  `getRequestEvent().locals` and throws or redirects itself. A
  `+page.server.ts` guards the page, not the data; the hook guards many
  routes. `.remote.ts` files import `$lib/server` but never live under it.
- `load` remains for redirects and the print-token page only.

## Known exceptions

The projects list and project detail pages hold their logic inline
(407 and 1,493 lines) and use `import * as` for their support modules.
They change on "UI library cleanup" (#33), not mid-feature.
